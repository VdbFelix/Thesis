# Thesis
This space will be used to develop and explore the Python script I am devising for my MPhil thesis. 

Right now I am facing a linguistic problem: my texts being in 16th century English, spaCy has a harder time recognising some of the Entities of Foxe's _Book of Martyrs_. Need to find how to circumvent this - is it possible to train spaCy's transformer model or should I use Python to 'clean' my text? How should this be done - can I modernise the spelling or train an algorithm to be able to interpret the text?
