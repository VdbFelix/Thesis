# Thesis
This repository contains the Python scripts used in the context of an MPhil thesis at Trinity College Dublin, "John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (1563-1583) through the pipeline: Named Entity Recognition in the study of early modern martyrdom". A domain-specific NER model for early modern English was trained before being deployed on the 1583 edition of John Foxe's _Actes and Monuments_.

The repository is organised in different folders and sub-folders for different tasks that were undertaken.
